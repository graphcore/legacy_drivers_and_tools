3. License Grants.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement including the timely payment of any and all fees (if any), Graphcore grants to Licensee the following personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable licenses under Graphcore's intellectual property rights as embodied in the Software on one or more computers exclusively controlled by Licensee: to install and use for the sole purpose of developing, synthesizing, testing, verifying and executing programs on Graphcore Devices.

(b) Limited Distributable Components License.

    (1) Certain Definitions.  "Distributable Component(s)" means those files supplied by Graphcore that are either Software or designated files within certain Software and that are identified by Graphcore in the associated text file or associated documentation as "redistributable", "restricted redistributable" or the like so as to clearly identify such Software or files as distributable pursuant to this Agreement. Such Distributable Components may be a library, a device driver, or firmware. Distributable Components may be supplied by Graphcore in either source code form (hereafter "Modifiable Form"), or in compiled form otherwise known as "object code" or "binary" (hereafter "Restricted Form").

    (2) Modifiable Form.  For Distributable Components supplied by Graphcore in Modifiable Form, Licensee may modify such Distributable Components, provided that the modifications are for use only with a Graphcore Device or to integrate a Graphcore Device in a product. Licensee makes all modifications at its own risk; Graphcore provides no warranty of any kind for a modified Distributable Component. Further restrictions on use and distribution rights are provided below.

    (3) Restricted Form. For Distributable Components supplied by Graphcore in Restricted Form, Licensee may not modify such Distributable Components, and may use such Distributable Components only with a Graphcore Device or to integrate a Graphcore Device in a product. Further restrictions on use and distribution rights are provided below.

    (4) Distribution Rights.  Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Licensee may distribute Distributable Components so long as such Distributable Components have been converted into a machine executable binary form and are provided in object code form; provided, Distributable Components when supplied by Graphcore in Modifiable Form may be distributed as-modified by Licensee in source code form if the distributee has a valid license from Graphcore to use the same underlying Software in Modifiable Form. Additionally, any subsequent recipient of the Software must agree in writing that the Distributed Components are to be used only with a Graphcore Device, and in a manner that is consistent with this Agreement, except that a subsequent recipient shall not have any further Distribution Rights unless the subsequent recipient has obtained a license directly from Graphcore with Distribution Rights.

(c) Third-Party Licenses, Open Source Excluded Licenses.  Certain files, programs or other materials distributed to Licensee in connection with the Software may originate from third-party licensors and are licensed to Licensee not under the terms and conditions of this Agreement, but rather pursuant to the terms and conditions of the applicable licenses that appear upon installation, acceptance and/or activation of the Software and/or are contained or described in the corresponding release notes or other documentation or header or source files.  Such files, programs or other materials may be subject to the terms of an open source or free software license.  Licensee agrees to carefully review and abide by the terms and conditions of these licenses to the extent that they govern the Software and/or such files, programs or other materials.  Licensee shall not use the Software in a manner that subjects any part of the Software to an Open Source Excluded License.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, as between Graphcore and Licensee, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law and if not prohibited by any such third-party licenses, all such third-party files, programs or other materials shall be deemed covered under Sections 10 (Disclaimers) and 11 (Limitation of Liability) and 13(c) (Governing Law) of this Agreement.

(d) Evaluation License. Licensee acknowledges that the license grants at Sections 3(a) and 3(b) above do not apply if Licensee's use of the Software is primarily for evaluation. If Licensee's primary use of the Software is for evaluation, Graphcore grants Licensee a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable licenses under Graphcore's intellectual property rights as embodied in the Software on one or more computers exclusively controlled by Licensee: to install and use the Software only for non-production, internal business evaluation in connection with the potential purchase of a Graphcore Device. Licensee shall ensure that Licensee's Users comply with this Agreement. Upon completion of the evaluation according to a separately agreed evaluation period or six (6) months if no such period has been agreed, Licensee i) shall return the Graphcore Device (if in Licensee's possession) together with any original packaging, and ii) immediately cease using the Software and destroy all copies in Licensee's possession.

(e) Feedback. Should Licensee provide Graphcore with feedback of any kind relating to Software or Graphcore Device, then Licensee hereby grants a non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license to Graphcore to use, implement, make derivative works of, and make, have-made, sell, offer to sell and import, Software and Graphcore Devices incorporating such feedback. Licensee represents and warrants that Licensee has all rights to provide the feedback and terms of use of the feedback to Graphcore.

4. Restrictions.

(a) Special Use Restrictions.  No right is granted hereunder to use the Software or any binary generated by use of the Software for use that is not i) in conjunction with a Graphcore Device, or ii) for the integration of a Graphcore Device into another product. Specifically, no right is granted hereunder to design, test, program or develop executable programs for non-Graphcore Devices. Further, in the event that Software includes any further restrictions on use beyond what is provided in this Agreement in the text file(s) associated with the Software, associated documentation or other notification accompanying the Software, then Licensee must abide by any and all of such further restrictions on use.

(b) No Tampering with Graphcore Device. If a Graphcore Device is provided with certain features disabled or locked, then the Software shall not be used to circumvent or hack into the disabled or locked features and Licensee shall not directly or indirectly attempt to activate or inactivate the disabled or locked features of the Graphcore Device without the prior written authorization of Graphcore.

(c) General Restrictions.  Except and only to the extent otherwise expressly allowed in this Agreement, Licensee is not licensed to, and agrees not to: (i) decompile, translate, reverse-engineer, disassemble, or otherwise reduce to human readable form the Software or the data files generated by the Software; (ii) transmit the Software or display the object code of the Software on any computer screen, or make any hard-copy memory dumps of the object code; (iii) use in or for any unlawful or malicious purpose including for the creation or spread of viruses, or to deceive or mislead; (iv) except as otherwise agreed in writing with Graphcore, publish or disclose the results of any comparisons including benchmarking of the Software or Graphcore Devices with other software or devices, or use such results for any other software or hardware development activities; (v) make any copies of the Software, except to make one (1) copy of the Software in machine-readable form solely for backup purposes; (v) modify or prepare derivative works of the Software, in whole or in part; (vi) make available discretely or as a service, hypothecate, rent, lease, loan, lend, time-share, sublicense, distribute or otherwise transfer the Software to any other individual, corporation or other legal entity; or (vii) remove, alter or obscure any product identification, ownership or intellectual property rights notices on or in the Software.

(d) Users also Restricted. For the avoidance of doubt, the restrictions contained in this Section 4 extend to Users and to that end, Licensee shall be liable for any act or omission of a User that results in the violation of this Section 4.

(e) No Conflict with Other Agreement. If Licensee and Graphcore have entered into a mutually signed agreement relating to Software, then in the event of conflicting terms with this Agreement, then those conflicting terms in the mutually signed agreement take precedence over this Agreement.

5. Intentionally Left Blank.

Licensee represents to Graphcore that it maintains a system of confidentiality consistent with commonly accepted practices to protect its own confidential business information, including written agreements with its Users, and that the Software will be protected by such a system to the same extent, but in no event with less than reasonable care.

8. Updates.

Graphcore reserves the right to make changes to the Software at any time, without notice. While Graphcore is not obligated to make any Updates, should any Updates be made, then Licensee shall treat the same as the "Software" under this Agreement for which such Update applies and use the Updates in a manner that is consistent with this Agreement.

9. No Obligation of Support.
